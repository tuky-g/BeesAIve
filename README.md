# BeesAIve
Bee saIve is an image classification system trained for the detection of invasive species, capable of putting the survival of honey bee colonies and pollinators at risk, created with the purpose of serving as an early warning tool for beekeepers.

To create the dataset we have used the images from the Kaggle dataset ["Bee or wasp"](https://www.kaggle.com/jerzydziewierz/bee-vs-wasp), which we have enriched with images from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/es/).

The complete dataset used is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1szjqLzrqK4usxtNFGHLFKImv5FUrvpHf?usp=sharing).

To download the images from Pixabay we have used the scraper from the article ["An easy way to scrape public domain images from Pixabay"](https://dev.to/cihankoseoglu_84/an-easy-way-to-scrape-public-domain-images-from-pixabay-5eeb).

Trained models can be downloaded from the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BrrobOFMfg_enQLyQI-XeMVydv1Izvcn?usp=sharing).
